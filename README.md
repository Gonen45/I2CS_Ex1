Ex01-Investigating polynomials

this project is an assigment in intro to computer scince, i requird to do functions that responsible on Investigating polynomials.
to demonstrate my knowledge and skills when working with arrayes and functions.

the functions:
1. f()- finding the f of some x for the polynom.
2. root_rec()- finding the root of the polynom in recursive method.
3. polyFromPoints()- for getting th polynom of 2 or 3 diffrent points.
4. equals()- for checking if to diffrent polynoms are the same.
5. poly()- a mathod to present a polynom from array like to string like (eg: {0,1,1} --> X^2 +1x +0)
6. sameValue()- for finding where the two polynoms have intersection.
7. length()- for finding the length between two points over the polynom.
8.
